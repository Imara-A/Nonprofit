                <h1>Conducting Career Guidance Programmes for Students hwo have completed 
                    the Ordinary level Examinations</h1>
                <p>
                    Students who have faced the Ordinary Level Examinations
                    come to a point where they struggle to decide on their future
                    career. The lack of awareness in about the world of work 
                    leads to the inability of choosing the proper subject stream
                    to continue their A/ls. Some students choose subjects that 
                    are extremely hard for them, and some choode subjects that 
                    wont benifit then for their desired feild of work. Students 
                    dont recieve required guidandeand support since most parents 
                    as well, do not pocess the knowledge to help their child.

                </p>
                <p>
                   We conducted this project to help students who are lost in 
                   their track, by showing a clear path for them and making the 
                   future clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Proffessionals in many leading feilds were invited to lecture
                   about the benifits and disadvantages of each and every feild
                   of work. The students were given proper knowledge on how to select 
                   the correct stream of their need. Apart from that, religeous and
                   cultural knowledge  was alsp provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program was completely free of charge, so as to make career 
                    advice available for the rich and poor like. The students as 
                    well as the parents were pleased with what they had gained at the 
                    end of the day.
