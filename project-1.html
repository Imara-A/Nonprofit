                <h1> Free Seminar for Grade 5 Students who are facing the Scholarship Examination</h1>
                <p>
                    The grade 5 scholarship exam is a competitive goverenment exam
                    faced by students at the age of 10. Around the area of Katugoda, 
                    students facevast difficulties preparing for this important exam
                    of their lives. This is mostly bacause of the inability to pay for 
                    tution classes due to economic background of students. These 
                    difficulties reduces the tendancy of students to pass the scholarship
                    exam successfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program was aimed to provide practice for students and gain confidence
                    to face this challenging exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a free seminar and workshop, and was open for any student 
                    who is studying in grade 5. The program was conducted by a school teacher
                    with prior experience with preparing students for the scholarship examination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program was a satisfaction for all participants as well as our Welfare
                    society. The students truly learned something new, and we intend to conduct
                     more similar programs in the future.
