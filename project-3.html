                <h1>Providing Food and Other Materials for Areas Affected by Natural Disasters</h1>
                <p>
                    Katugoda is an area that is mostly affected by floods and landslides, the most 
                    often one being floods. The low land areas are freaquently flooded even at the slightest
                    rain. People who work for daily wedges are unable to leave their homes on these days,
                    thus being unable to earn the money required to provide themselves with the food 
                    required for the particular day. At some occations, the case is that, some are unable to 
                    cook their food since the kitchens are subjected to flooding as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of this program is to provide not only food, but also other essencial items 
                    to facilitate living for the people who are affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flood affected areas are pre-Identifid by us. At the notice of a risk of 
                    flooding, these areas are inspected and necessary steps are taken to provide relief
                    for these people according to paln. The items that are to be distributed are 
                    pre-collected and kept in store for emergancies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting this program has helped people numerous times so far, at times they are 
                    strangled in these disasterous situations.
