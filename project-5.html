                <h1>Providing Financial Aid to Pay the Cless Fees of Poor children</h1>
                <p>
                    There are many students in the village of Katugoda, who are 
                    talented and dedicated for studies, but are unable to continue 
                    education due to economic difficulties faced by their parents.
                    Since most wemen are house-wives, if the child's father is 
                    unable to work under any circumstance, the family has no 
                    income at all. Most people work for daily wedges to provide
                    themselves with the three meals. People with such economic 
                    difficulties face troubles to provide facilities and financial 
                    support for their childrens' education. Such students are given
                    valuble opportunities through this program. Mostly we provide this 
                    aid for students who are facing Advanced Level exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We intend to make education easy and accessible for the ones who 
                   consider it as a great burden, and provide opportunities for 
                   talented students to drive towords success.
                </p>
                <p>
                   First we inspect the income of selected families and identify
                   students with financial needs. Prority is given to students 
                   whose fathers are unable to work. Class fees are paid by the 
                   Katugoda Welfare Society for the selected students, untill
                   they face the exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many young telented students have gained great opportunities
                    through our efforts. We have been able to produce many educated 
                    individuals in Katugoda through this.
