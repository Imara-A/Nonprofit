                <h1> Free Stationary Distribution Students From Families With Low Income</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to the currently prevailing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, most people, 
                    especially in Katugoda, are unable to earn an amount that would suffice their
                    consumption. In a time when most can not afford to provide the three meals of the day,
                    there are many who are unable to buy books and other stationary items for the new 
                    school term. The inability of parents to buy the required items for the education
                    of their children, makes the children mentally distressed. The free education of 
                    Sri Lanka is disrupted by such economic difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program is aimed to provide economic relief to poor parents, amd mental relief 
                    to the dedicated students by providing Stationary and other items required for education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parents with most dificulties was identified by our society members livilng in Katugoda.
                    They were then talked to, and we obtainded the list of necessary items. After buying
                    required items they were distributed accordingly, with supervision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The selected recipients were pleased with our offerings, and the students were willing to 
                    do their best in education. The satisfaction of the people was a pleasure to us, here
                    at Katugoda Welfare Society
                </p>
